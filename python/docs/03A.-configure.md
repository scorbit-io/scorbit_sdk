# Configure

After authentication, and prior to heartbeating or posting scores, you must POST (one time) to the api/installed endpoint. This step ensures that we know the machine code version you are speaking from. This also gives the API an opportunity to send any custom data in the response prior to engaging in heartbeats and entry/score POSTs.

### POST https://{base\_url}/api/installed/

{% swagger src=".gitbook/assets/swagger-config-manufacturer.json" path="/api/installed/" method="post" %}
[swagger-config-manufacturer.json](.gitbook/assets/swagger-config-manufacturer.json)
{% endswagger %}

The type can be one of the following:

* `provider`
* `config`
* `score_detector`
