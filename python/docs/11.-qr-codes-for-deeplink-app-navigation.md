# QR Codes for Deeplink App Navigation

### Deeplinking Navigation and Claiming Slots with a QR Code

When a game session is active, we recommend presenting a QR code on the game's display while the player's ball is in the shooter lane.

`https://scorbit.link/qrcode?$deeplink_path=[venuemachineID]&opdb=[opdbID]&position=[player number]`

For example:

`https://scorbit.link/qrcode?$deeplink_path=22332&opdb=GRD79-M0odk&position=1`

Where the parameters translate to:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| deeplink\_path | This represents the internal URL used by the OS and the app to determine the app behavior upon scanning. |
| venuemachineID | This is the paired venuemachineID and is presented in authentication and heartbeat responses.            |
| opdbID         | This is the unique identifier in the [Open Pinball Database](https://opdb.org/)                          |
| position       | OPTIONAL, Integer representing the player number.                                                        |
